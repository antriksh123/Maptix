### Documentation

For the frontend, we have used React.js. The React.js contents can be found in `src/userland`. The userland folder contains all the code for the frontend/user.

The webpack folder contains the webpack configuration for React.js. We have used css-loader as well as sass-loader for use of both, CSS and SASS.

The utils folder contains some helpful functions. The `getWindowPosition.js` file contains code for positioning the window vertically and horizontally.

The test folder contains all the tests for the application. The tests include checking the browser window.
